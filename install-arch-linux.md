# Steps to Install Arch Linux in VirtualBox on Windows 11

### Download the Arch Linux.
Once done, you need to head to Arch Linux’s official website to download the ISO file. [Click here](https://archlinux.org/download/)

### Creating the Virtual Machine.
Launch VirtualBox and click on “New” to create a virtual machine.

Enter the name of your virtual machine, it should auto-detect the “Type” and “Version” respectively when you type in “Arch Linux” in the name field.

You should increase the memory size to use the virtual machine comfortably. If it is just for minor testing, you can go ahead with the default setting.
In my case, I allocate ~4 GB of RAM.

Also, make sure to create a virtual hard disk under the “Hard disk” option. It should be the selected option by default.

Next, you need to select the hard disk file type as “VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)” and the storage as “Dynamically allocated,” as shown in the image above.

You can choose a preferred location path for the virtual hard disk and tweak the size as per your requirements. The installation should not be a problem with the minimum allocated size (8 GB), but to be on the safe side, you may want to allocate at least 10-15 GB.
